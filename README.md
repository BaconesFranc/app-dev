 2. #Description
 3.   John Singleton directed the 2003 action movie 2 Fast 2 Furious, which was based on a plot by Michael Brandt, Derek Haas, and Gary Scott Thompson. It is the second entry in the Fast & Furious franchise and the follow-up to The Fast and the Furious (2001). Alongside Tyrese Gibson, Eva Mendes, Cole Hauser, Chris "Ludacris" Bridges, and James Remar, Paul Walker plays Brian O'Conner in the movie. In the movie, criminal Miami-based import-export broker Carter Verone (Hauser) hires ex-LAPD officer Brian O'Conner and his ex-con pal Roman Pearce (Gibson) to convey a load of "dirty" money while secretly collaborating with undercover agent Monica Fuentes (Mendes) to bring Verone down.
